                Said to be the most haunted castle in Britain, Chillingham is claimed to be home to various spectres.
                The White Pantry Ghost was first spotted by a footman, who’d been locked into the pantry overnight to
                guard the family silver. He reported her as begging for water and it’s now thought she was a victim of
                 poisoning. <br> In the chapel, the voices of two men are often overheard talking but can never be 
                 traced. Visitors say the ghosts are often friendly. The castle holds special ghost tours throughout 
                 the year and groups of ten or more can enjoy a candlelit meal by a roaring fire in the 
                 Minstrels’ Hall beforehand.
